When your Project is Opened, you will see an Interface for creating apps called Designer. Where it has Component Platte at Left an Android Device Mockup at Center and a Properties tab at Right along with some Buttons in the top menu.<br><br>Now you can use the components from Palette and drag them to Mockup Screen to add then in your app and use Properties tab to change look/properties of the component. You can also add External Files like Images, Fonts, Pdf, Json, Etc.

App Inventor distributions are same as AI2 but with different themes &amp; tweaks. They are kind of commercial version so you will see may differents components in then except that one in AI2. The extra components are very useful. You can also monetize your application by using ads components which are present there and many more...<br><br>As these distros provide you many different things along with the basic app inventor, you will have to pay them. Most of them have a monthly/early subscription. But some works on different model get paid. For Example. Kodular is completely free of cost, you will have to pay $0 to use it. But if you want to monetize your app, then kodular will take some part of ads and display their ads as a part of commission based revenue system. This commission can be removed by paying a monthly fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Similarly Niotron has a different type of model to generate revenue from their service.<br><br>&nbsp;Some of the known Distros are :<br>1.

The recent increase in the clones shows that they want to extend the platform which couldn't made possible with App Inventor itself due to its use of education. And this is good because they spread the message of App Inventor which is enabling everyone to create apps.</blockquote><figcaption>Pavitra Golchha, VP of Innovation Kodular</figcaption></figure><p><strong>+</strong> Your views on IOS App Developement with AI2 ?<br><br>Answer by <strong><a href="https://community.appinventor.mit.edu/u/ewpatton" target="_blank" data-link-popup-id="1613644594384">Evan Patton</a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>We continue to work with Apple App Store Review to get the MIT App Inventor Companion approved for use on iOS. They have more stringent requirements than Google so it's taking more time than I think most folks would like, but we have to play by their rules. We have a couple thousand beta testers using it at this point and it seems to be going fairly well. Internally we're also turning our attention toward the build system and what that will entail from an infrastructure perspective.</blockquote><figcaption>Evan Patton, lead software engineer for the MIT App Inventor.</figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong><strong>+</strong> How do you see App Inventor and it’s distributions like kodular in next 5 years ?<br><br>Answer by <a href="https://twitter.com/puravidaapps" target="_blank"><strong>Taifun&nbsp;</strong></a><a href="https://twitter.com/puravidaapps" target="_blank"><strong></strong></a><br></p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>MIT App Inventor still will be there, there is MIT behind and as it is open source it will live “forever”…<br>distributions usually are closed source, so it will depend on the teams… an important part is being able to pay the bills, for example server costs as well as improving the builder, so there must be something to generate income… without that and without a large user base there will be no future for a distribution</blockquote><figcaption>Taifun, PuraVida Apps</figcaption></figure><p><strong>+ </strong>Can AI2 completely replace Android Studio in future ?<br><br>Answer by <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterM66" target="_blank"><strong>Peter&nbsp;Mathijssen</strong></a><br></p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>In theory it could, but i don't think that will happen.

We've seem some fantastic apps over the years from both young students and adults who have little to no coding experience but see a struggle of a friend or family member and make an impact in their lives. That is an extremely powerful gift. So as you use App Inventor, think about the challenges you see in the world and in your communities and think about how the skills you are learning could be put to use to improve someone's life or the lives of many.</blockquote><figcaption>Evan Patton, lead software engineer for the MIT App Inventor.</figcaption></figure><hr class="separator separator--dots"><p>I thanks Evan Patton, Taifun, Peter Mathijssen, Pavitra to give your valuable time to us and answers these questions, users will find these helpful.<br><br><br>Hope this article helped you to gain some new and Interesting Information, if so then share this to your Family and Friends also.<br><br>Have Questions about this article or another, Join our <a href="https://t.me/logycrealm" target="_blank"><strong>LOGYC Realm</strong></a> on telegram and ask your doubts.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Peace ☮️&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on February 18, 2021</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.logyc.xyz%2Fapp-inventor-and-its-distributions%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.logyc.xyz%2Fapp-inventor-and-its-distributions%2F&amp;via=%40reallogyc&amp;text=App%20Inventor%20and%20its%20Distributions%20%7C%20LOGYC%C2%A0" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.logyc.xyz%2Fapp-inventor-and-its-distributions%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.logyc.xyz%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F13%2F20210207_14492.jpg&amp;description=App%20Inventor%20and%20its%20Distributions%20%7C%20LOGYC%C2%A0" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Pinterest"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.logyc.xyz%2Fapp-inventor-and-its-distributions%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Mix"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="https://wa.me/?text=App%20Inventor%20and%20its%20Distributions%20%7C%20LOGYC%C2%A0 https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.logyc.xyz%2Fapp-inventor-and-its-distributions%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.logyc.xyz%2Fapp-inventor-and-its-distributions%2F&amp;title=App%20Inventor%20and%20its%20Distributions%20%7C%20LOGYC%C2%A0" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=App%20Inventor%20and%20its%20Distributions%20%7C%20LOGYC%C2%A0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.logyc.xyz%2Fapp-inventor-and-its-distributions%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Buffer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><ul class="post__tag box"><li><a href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/tags/articles/" class="u-tag u-tag--1" title="Articles">Articles</a></li></ul><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/kodular-no-code-app-creator/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://notes.logyc.xyz/media/posts/12/responsive/65-xs.PNG" loading="lazy" alt=""><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Kodular - No Code App Creator </h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://notes.logyc.xyz/app-inventor-and-distributions-or-q-and-a-or-intresting/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>App Inventor &amp;
